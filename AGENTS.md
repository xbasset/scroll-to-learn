# AGENTS.MD

Xavier owns this. Start: say hi + 1 motivating line.
Work style: telegraph; noun-phrases ok; drop grammar; min tokens.

## Agent Protocol
- Contact: Xavier Basset (@xbasset, xavier@xbasset.com).
- Workspace: `~/workspace`. Missing xbasset repo: clone `https://github.com/xbasset/<repo>.git`.
- 3rd-party/OSS (non-xbasset): clone under `~/workspace/oss`.
- Files: repo or `~/workspace/agent-scripts`.
- PRs: use `gh pr view/diff` (no URLs).
- “Make a note” => edit AGENTS.md (shortcut; not a blocker). Ignore `CLAUDE.md`.
- No `./runner`. Guardrails: use `trash` for deletes.
- Need upstream file: stage in `/tmp/`, then cherry-pick; never overwrite tracked.
- Bugs: add regression test when it fits.
- Keep files <~500 LOC; split/refactor as needed.
- Commits: Conventional Commits (`feat|fix|refactor|build|ci|chore|docs|style|perf|test`).
- Editor: `cursor <path>`.
- CI: `gh run list/view` (rerun/fix til green).
- Prefer end-to-end verify; if blocked, say what’s missing.
- New deps: quick health check (recent releases/commits, adoption).
- Web: search early; quote exact errors; prefer 2024–2025 sources.
- Style: telegraph. Drop filler/grammar. Min tokens (global AGENTS + replies).

## Screenshots (“use a screenshot”)
- Pick newest PNG in `~/Desktop` or `~/Downloads`.
- Verify it’s the right UI (ignore filename).
- Size: `sips -g pixelWidth -g pixelHeight <file>` (prefer 2×).
- Optimize: `imageoptim <file>` (install: `brew install imageoptim-cli`).
- Replace asset; keep dimensions; commit; run gate; verify CI.

## Docs
- Start: open docs before coding.
- Keep notes short; update docs when behavior/API changes (no ship w/o docs).

## PR Feedback
- Active PR: `gh pr view --json number,title,url --jq '"PR #\\(.number): \\(.title)\\n\\(.url)"'`.
- PR comments: `gh pr view …` + `gh api …/comments --paginate`.
- Replies: cite fix + file/line; resolve threads only after fix lands.

## Build / Test
- Before handoff: run full gate (lint/typecheck/tests/docs).
- CI red: `gh run list/view`, rerun, fix, push, repeat til green.
- Keep it observable (logs, panes, tails, MCP/browser tools).
- Release: read `docs/RELEASING.md` (or find best checklist if missing).
- Reminder: check `~/.zprofile` for missing env keys.

## Git
- Safe by default: `git status/diff/log`. Push only when user asks.
- `git checkout` ok for PR review / explicit request.
- Branch changes require user consent.
- Destructive ops forbidden unless explicit (`reset --hard`, `clean`, `restore`, `rm`, …).
- Remotes under `~/workspace`: prefer HTTPS; flip SSH->HTTPS before pull/push.
- Don’t delete/rename unexpected stuff; stop + ask.
- No repo-wide S/R scripts; keep edits small/reviewable.
- Avoid manual `git stash`; if Git auto-stashes during pull/rebase, that’s fine (hint, not hard guardrail).
- If user types a command (“pull and push”), that’s consent for that command.
- No amend unless asked.
- Big review: `git --no-pager diff --color=never`.
- Multi-agent: check `git status/diff` before edits; ship small commits.

## Language/Stack Notes
- Swift: use workspace helper/daemon; validate `swift build` + tests; keep concurrency attrs right.
- TypeScript: use repo PM; keep files small; follow existing patterns.

## macOS Permissions / Signing (TCC)
- Never re-sign / ad-hoc sign / change bundle ID as “debug” without explicit ok (can mess TCC).

## Critical Thinking
- Fix root cause (not band-aid).
- Unsure: read more code; if still stuck, ask w/ short options.
- Conflicts: call out; pick safer path.
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes. If it causes issues, stop + ask user.
- Leave breadcrumb notes in thread.

## Frontend Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Remember: LLMs like you are capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.
